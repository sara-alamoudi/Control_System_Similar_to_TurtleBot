# Control_System_Similar_to_TurtleBot
The system was created using TinckerCad

The components of the circuit were as following:

- Arduino Uno
- Two DC Motors(each moves in two Directions (clockwise and counterclockwise ) to demonstrate the four directions(right, left, forward, and backward))
- Battery(for charging the motors)
- UltraSonic Distance Sensor(to measure the distance)
- LCD(displays the distance)
- Potentiometer(Controls the brightness of the LCD)
- Breadboard Small
- Breadboard Mini
- Resistor
